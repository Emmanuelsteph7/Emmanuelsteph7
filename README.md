## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I am a Front-End Developer who loves designing and developing responsive and user-friendly web pages that are fast and built with the best practices. I achieve these using technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and CSS pre-processors like Sass.

I also have experience in building applications that interacts with server-side APIs and I manage these applications using state management libraries like Redux, and technologies like Context API in React Js.

In addition to making clean and functional web pages, I am also acquainted with the server-side using Node Js, Express Js framework, and Mongo DB.

My greatest strength is the drive to always improve and learn new technologies. Being up to date with the latest trends in web development is a constant routine for me.

Git, GitHub, GitLab

I am open to Frontend job opportunities.
